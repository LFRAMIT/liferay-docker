## About

These images are the base software stack for Liferay bundle Docker images. They contain Alpine Linux as OS, Zulu JDK, tools and scripts to run Liferay products. More information can be found in the Dockerfile at http://github.com/liferay/liferay-docker.

## Tags

For [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/base/tags) that follow the format *{version}-{date}*, *version* denotes the version of the image, and *date* denotes the date when the Docker image was made.

[Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/base/tags) that follow the format *{version}* always point to the latest tag that follows the format *{version}-{date}*.

The version number is determined based on general semantic versioning principles. Release notes can be find by [searching for the version tags in Liferay's issue tracker system](https://issues.liferay.com/issues/?jql=labels%20in%20(d1.1.0)). The version number consists of 3 parts *{major}-{minor}-{patch}*. Increment happens to the:

 - {major} version when a potential breaking change is made (i.e. previous extension points are not available or work differently)
 - {minor} version when a new functionality is added in a backwards compatible manner
 - {patch} version when backwards compatible bug fixes are made.

## Running

To start Liferay ${product_name}, replace {tag} and execute:

\`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 liferay/${product_id}:{tag}\`

For example:

\`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 liferay/${product_id}:${product_version}\`

The \`-it\` argument allows you to stop the container with CTRL-C. Otherwise, you have to use \`docker kill {containerId}\` to stop the container.

The \`-p 8080:8080\` argument maps the container's port 8080 with the host's port 8080 so that you can access Liferay ${product_name} from a browser.

## Environment Variables

You can tune the default JVM parameters by setting the environment variable \`LIFERAY_JVM_OPTS\`.

You can customize the behavior of Liferay ${product_name} via environment variables that map to portal.properties. For example, if you want to provide only English and Portuguese, you could create a portal-ext.properties with the entry:

\`locales.enabled=en_US,pt_BR\`

Or, you could set the environment variable:

\`LIFERAY_LOCALES_PERIOD_ENABLED=en_US,pt_BR\`

Each property's respective environment variable is documented in [portal.properties](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/portal.properties). Search for the text \`Env:\`.

Environment variables take precedence over portal.properties.

## File System

Docker containers are transient. Whenever you reboot a container, all changes on its file system are lost.

To quickly test changes without building a new image, map the host's file system to the container's file system.

Start the container with the option \`-v \$(pwd)/xyz123:/mnt/liferay\` to bridge \`\$(pwd)/xyz123\` in the host operating system to \`/mnt/liferay\` on the container.

Files in the host directory \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/files\` are also available in the container directory \`/mnt/liferay/files\` and will be copied to \`/opt/liferay\` before Liferay ${product_name} starts.

For example, if you want to modify Tomcat's setenv.sh file, then place your changes in \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/files/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh\` and setenv.sh will be overwritten in \`/opt/liferay/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh\` before Liferay ${product_name} starts.

## Scripts

All scripts in the container directory \`/mnt/liferay/scripts\` will be executed before before Liferay ${product_name} starts. Place your scripts in \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/scripts\`.

## Deploy

Copy files to \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/deploy\` on the host operating system to deploy modules to Liferay ${product_name} at runtime.

## About

Images are built based off of OpenJDK on Alpine. More information can be found in the Dockerfile at http://github.com/liferay/liferay-docker.
