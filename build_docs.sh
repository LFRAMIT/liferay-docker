## Tags

For [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/${1}/tags) that follow the format *{version}-{date}*, *version* denotes the version of Liferay ${2}, and *date* denotes the date when the Docker image was made.

[Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/${1}/tags) that follow the format *{version}* always point to the latest tag that follows the format *{version}-{date}*.

## Running

To start Liferay ${2}, replace {tag} and execute:

\`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 liferay/${1}:{tag}\`

For example:

\`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 liferay/${1}:${3}\`

The \`-it\` argument allows you to stop the container with CTRL-C. Otherwise, you have to use \`docker kill {containerId}\` to stop the container.

The \`-p 8080:8080\` argument maps the container's port 8080 with the host's port 8080 so that you can access Liferay ${2} from a browser.

## Environment Variables

You can tune the default JVM parameters by setting the environment variable \`LIFERAY_JVM_OPTS\`.

You can customize the behavior of Liferay ${2} via environment variables that map to portal.properties. For example, if you want to provide only English and Portuguese, you could create a portal-ext.properties with the entry:

\`locales.enabled=en_US,pt_BR\`

Or, you could set the environment variable:

\`LIFERAY_LOCALES_PERIOD_ENABLED=en_US,pt_BR\`

Each property's respective environment variable is documented in [portal.properties](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-impl/src/portal.properties). Search for the text \`Env:\`.

Environment variables take precedence over portal.properties.

## File System

Docker containers are transient. Whenever you reboot a container, all changes on its file system are lost.

To quickly test changes without building a new image, map the host's file system to the container's file system.

Start the container with the option \`-v \$(pwd)/xyz123:/mnt/liferay\` to bridge \`\$(pwd)/xyz123\` in the host operating system to \`/mnt/liferay\` on the container.

Files in the host directory \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/files\` are also available in the container directory \`/mnt/liferay/files\` and will be copied to \`/opt/liferay\` before Liferay ${2} starts.

For example, if you want to modify Tomcat's setenv.sh file, then place your changes in \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/files/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh\` and setenv.sh will be overwritten in \`/opt/liferay/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh\` before Liferay ${2} starts.

## Scripts

All scripts in the container directory \`/mnt/liferay/scripts\` will be executed before before Liferay ${2} starts. Place your scripts in \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/scripts\`.

## Deploy

Copy files to \`\$(pwd)/xyz123/deploy\` on the host operating system to deploy modules to Liferay ${2} at runtime.

## About

Images are built based off of OpenJDK on Alpine. More information can be found in the Dockerfile at http://github.com/liferay/liferay-docker.
